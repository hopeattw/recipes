# [Earl Grey Tea Cake](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021062-earl-grey-tea-cake-with-dark-chocolate-and-orange-zest?smid=yt-nytfood&smtyp=cur)

## Prep Time
1 hour plus chilling

## Ingredients

Frosting:

- 3/4 cup/180 ml heavy cream
- 2 teaspoons loose Earl Grey tea (one sachet is 1 teaspoon)
- 1/4 cup/30 g confectioners' sugar
- 1/4 cup/57 g softened cream cheese (this is honestly optional... the whipped cream is great)

Cake:

- 1/2 cup/115 g unsalted butter (1 stick @ room temp)
- 1 1/2 cup/190 g all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp Earl Grey tea
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 cup/200 g granulated sugar
- 2 tsp grated orange zest
- 2 large eggs @ room temp
- 1/2 cup/120 ml milk @ room temp
- 1/4 cup/45 g chopped dark chocolate

## Instructions
1. Have butter, cream cheese, milk, eggs out on counter to get to room temp
2. Prepare the frosting. Bring 1/2 cup of the heavy cream to simmer, add loose tea, remove from heat, cover and let stand for at least 30 mins -- strain tea out after an hour and chill the remaining cream until completely cold (at least an hour)
	- Chilling the cream completely is important to having it whip later
3. Preheat oven to 350 F
4. Butter + line round 8-inch cake pan with parchment paper
5. Whisk together flour, tea, baking powder, salt
6. Beat butter and sugar in another bowl until light and fluffy (3 mins)
7. Add orange zest to butter+sugar. Then add eggs, one at a time, and beat until combined
8. Beat flour mixture in slowly until just combined
9. Add milk until just combined 
10. Fold in chocolate 
11. Transfer batter to prepared pan and smooth top (it's a pretty thick batter)
12. Bake for 30-35 mins (took 40-ish mins last time)
13. Cool in tin for 15 mins and then tip out for final cool
14. Finish frosting. Make sure cream cheese is very soft and whip until fluffy
15. Add remaining 1/4 cup of heavy cream to steeped cream (didn't do this last time and it was fine lol)
16. Whip until soft peaks -- add confectioners sugar 
17. Add whipped cream cheese until combined 
18. Top cake with frosting
