# Beef and flat beans stirfry

## Prep Time
15 mins

## Ingredients
- beef
- string beans 
- oyster sauce (sub. soy sauce + sugar)
- corn starch

## Instructions
1. Slice beef into strips
2. Marinate beef with enough cornstarch, oyster sauce to coat every strip lightly 
3. Cut flat beans diagonally, making very narrow parallelograms
4. Stir fry cut flat beans in some oil with some salt on medium-high, so they don't char (don't salt too much at this step -- it's just to bring out the natural sweetness of the beans; majority of seasoning will come from the beef marinade)
4. Cook until desired doneness and put flat beans on separate plate
5. Add more oil to the pan and cook the beef on high heat until well-done 
6. Turn off the heat and add the flat beans back in to combine
